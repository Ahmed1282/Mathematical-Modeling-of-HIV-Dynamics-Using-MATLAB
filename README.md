# Mathematical-Modeling-of-HIV-Dynamics-Using-MATLAB
MATLAB project models HIV dynamics using differential equations.

Objective of this project is to create a MATLAB program for mathematical model of HIV dynamics using the equations and concepts of Differential Equations studied in our course. We start our work by studying the Mathematical model of HIV dynamics given in the question, breaking down into simple processes, using the variables of population which is uninfected of CD4+ T cells, population which is infected of CD4+ T cells, and population at the time of virus. All of the variables are taken at time T. 


1. The project aims to create a MATLAB program to model the HIV dynamics using differential equations.

2. The model considers the population of uninfected CD4+ T cells (T), infected CD4+ T cells (I), and the virus population (V) at time t.
Analytical solutions for the three variables are derived from their respective differential equations.

3. MATLAB is used for solving the differential equations and visualizing the results.

4. The model incorporates several parameters, such as the constant input source of uninfected cells (λ), normal loss rate constant of uninfected cells (δ), loss rate 

5. constant of infected cells (μ), number of virions produced per day per infected cell (N), and loss rate constant of free virus (γ).

6. The MATLAB code uses symbolic variables and the 'dsolve' command to find the analytical solutions for T(t), I(t), and V(t).

7. Assumptions for the parameter values are made to solve the equations and plot the graphs using the 'fimplicit' function.

8. The project demonstrates the use of mathematical modeling to understand HIV dynamics and potentially improve treatment strategies.

9. The MATLAB code is designed to be user-friendly, with clear instructions and comments explaining each step.

10. The code starts with a clear workspace and command window, displaying the project and group member details.

11. The differential equations and initial conditions for T(t), I(t), and V(t) are declared using symbolic variables.

12. The 'dsolve' command is used to find the analytical solutions, which are then displayed in the command window.

13. The parameter values are assumed, and the equations are solved again to obtain specific solutions for T(t), I(t), and V(t).

14. The 'fimplicit' function is employed to plot the solutions on a graph, which provides a visual representation of the HIV dynamics.

15. The code concludes by displaying the end of the program in the command window.

16. The project showcases the application of mathematical modeling using MATLAB to study complex biological systems like HIV dynamics. By understanding these dynamics, researchers can develop better treatment strategies and contribute to the ongoing battle against HIV and AIDS.
